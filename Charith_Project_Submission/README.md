# IPL Win Predictor

This project predicts the win probability of an IPL match based on the current match situation.

## Project Structure
- `IPL_Win_Predictor.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for the user interface.
- `matches.csv`: Dataset containing match details.
- `deliveries.csv`: Dataset containing ball-by-ball delivery details.
- `pipe.pkl`: Trained machine learning pipeline (generated by the notebook).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `Procfile` & `setup.sh`: Configuration files for deployment (e.g., Heroku).

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2.  **Generate the Model:**
    Run the `IPL_Win_Predictor.ipynb` notebook to train the model and save `pipe.pkl`.

3.  **Run the App:**
    streamlit run app.py

## Model Details
The model uses Logistic Regression to predict the win probability. It considers factors like runs left, balls left, wickets left, current run rate, and required run rate.
